### FAQ

#### How to use?
If you want to just use, you can download full project from github and use 'thor.min.js' located in 'compiled' folder.

#### Where is documentation?
Here [https://github.com/renie/thor.Js/wiki] .

#### Why is your documentation on Github? Why not an standalone website?
For a while, this is just a personal project. But people enjoy it, I'll think about
a more professional documentation.

#### I have a good feature or an idea for a feature. How can I suggest you to add this on Thor?
You can fork my project here on Github or you can send me an e-mail.

#### What do I get for contributing?
My thanks. That awesome feeling of helping other. May be your name here in the project =)

#### Why so many simple functions?
Exactly because of simplicity, it should be simple and fast. Many people used to import
big javascript libraries just to use this kind of functions. This results in large requests 
and performance below that it could be.

#### Are you telling me I shouldn't use libs like jQuery?
Not at all. But you should used this libraries when there is a really advantage of this use.
Import almost 90kb and loose lots of performance(comparisons links: [getting styles](http://jsperf.com/style-getter), [getting styles setted on stylesheets](http://jsperf.com/style-getter-stylesheet), [selectors](http://jsperf.com/default-selectors), [id selectors](http://jsperf.com/simple-id-selection)) just to verifing existence/toggle classes and use selectors doesn't seem to be a nice choice. 

#### You're an idiot trying to reinvent the wheel. Just a motherf*cker that started coding yesterday and thinks is better than other programmers!!
Like you too =D.
